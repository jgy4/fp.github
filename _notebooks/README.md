# About Me

Welcome! My name is Jasmine Young and I'm currently a Data Science Master's student at Duke University. I'll use this site to post some of my projects and portfolio work. I work primarily in python, though I am also familiar with SQL, and R. My undergraduate degree is in Operations Research & Financial Engineering from Princeton University.
